*A place for people looking for ideas and ideas looking for people.*

**Do you know you want to make something, but not sure what?**

[Glint](http://glintapp.azurewebsites.net/) is a forum for people to find and share project ideas. Anyone can submit an idea and give feedback. All the ideas you find on Glint are vetted by the Glint community.

Find the next big idea!

**It's hard to find the right idea.**   
&nbsp;&nbsp;-You need a project to learn a new language or start a new company, but you don't know what to make.

**You have an amazing idea, but no way to make it.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;-You don't know where to start, and you want to collaborate to make your idea happen.

**You want to give back.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;-You have way more ideas than time to make things, and you want to help inspire others.

**Glint makes it easy!**
